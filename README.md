# **🎙 Speech-to-Text Transcription using Wav2Vec2**  

This project leverages **Facebook's Wav2Vec2** model to transcribe speech from audio files into text. It uses **Hugging Face Transformers**, **Torch**, and **PyDub** for efficient audio processing and transcription.  

---

## **🚀 Features**  
✅ Converts speech from `.wav` files into text  
✅ Uses **Facebook's Wav2Vec2-Large-960h** model for transcription  
✅ Works with **Google Colab** for easy execution  
✅ Supports long audio files without truncation  
✅ Outputs transcription in a **clean, readable format**

## **🛠 Installation & Setup**  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
Make sure you have the required Python libraries:  
```bash
pip install torch torchaudio transformers pydub
```

If using **Google Colab**, run this in a code cell:  
```python
!pip install torch torchaudio transformers pydub
```

## **🎯 Usage**  

### **1️⃣ Upload Your Audio File**  
If using **Google Colab**, upload your `.wav` file manually or place it in `/content/`.  

### **2️⃣ Run the Transcription Script**  
Execute the Colab notebook:  
- Open **`speech_to_text.ipynb`** in Google Colab  
- Run all cells to transcribe the uploaded audio file  

Or, run the Python script locally:  
```python
python transcription.py
```

### **3️⃣ Output Example**
```
Transcribed Text:
Solar energy involves capturing the energy from the sun and converting it into electricity. We use that electricity to light and heat our homes...

## **📌 Notes & Troubleshooting**  
- Ensure your **audio file is in `.wav` format**  
- If **transcription is incomplete**, check if the full audio was loaded into Colab  
- Wav2Vec2 **performs best with clear, noiseless audio**
